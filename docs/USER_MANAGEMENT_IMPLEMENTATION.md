- Permissions: Real-time (no cache)
- Stores: Real-time (no cache)

### API Endpoints Used:

- `profile/api.php?action=get_activities&user_id={id}`
- `profile/api.php?action=get_permissions&user_id={id}`
- `profile/api.php?action=update_permission`
- `profile/api.php?action=get_stores&user_id={id}`
- `profile/api.php?action=get_available_stores&user_id={id}`
- `profile/api.php?action=add_store_access`
- `profile/api.php?action=remove_store_access`
- `profile/api.php?action=export_activities&format={csv|json|pdf}`
- `profile/api.php?action=update_user` (for edit user)
- `register.php` (for create user)

## 📊 Statistics & Metrics
