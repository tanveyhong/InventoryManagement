## API Considerations

### Nominatim Rate Limiting

- **Solution**: 150ms debounce prevents exceeding limit

### Recommendations for Production
1. **Add User-Agent header**
   ```javascript
   headers: {
       'User-Agent': 'InventorySystem/1.0 (your-email@domain.com)'
   }
   ```

2. **Implement server-side proxy**
   - Cache frequent searches
   - Rate limit management
   - Better error handling

3. **Consider paid alternatives for heavy use**
   - Google Maps Geocoding API
   - Mapbox Geocoding API
   - HERE Geocoding API
