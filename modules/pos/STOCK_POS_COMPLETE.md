# âœ… Stock-POS Integration Complete!

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Product Distribution** âœ…
Created `distribute_products.php` that:
- Automatically distributes products to all POS-enabled stores
- Adds 5 common products (available in all stores)
- Adds 5 unique products per store (store-specific inventory)
- Prevents duplicate entries
- Shows detailed progress and summary

**Result**: 60 new products added across 6 POS stores

### 2. **Product Inventory** âœ…
Successfully distributed:
- **Store #6 (ae)**: 56 total products
- **Store #7 (duag)**: 10 products  
- **Store #8 (Vey Hong Tandddd)**: 10 products
- **Store #9 (sparkling water)**: 10 products
- **Store #10 (Pork John Pork)**: 10 products
- **Store #12 (vienna)**: 10 products

### 3. **Integration Dashboard** âœ…
Created `stock_pos_integration.php` with:
- Real-time store overview (products, stock, sales)
- Low stock alerts (products below reorder level)
- Out of stock alerts (zero inventory items)
- Recent sales from POS system
- Quick actions to POS and Stock modules
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### 4. **Database Integration** âœ…
All data stored in SQL database:
- `products` table: Inventory items with quantities
- `sales` table: POS transactions
- `sale_items` table: Individual sale line items
- `stock_movements` table: All inventory changes
- `stores` table: Store information with POS flags

## How It Works
