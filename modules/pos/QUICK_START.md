2. Store ID saved in session
3. Product list filtered by store_id
```

### When You Complete a Sale:
```
1. Sale record created with store_id
2. Transaction ID generated (TXN-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
3. Each item recorded in sale_items table
4. Inventory decreased for each product
5. Sale linked to your user account
6. All in one database transaction (safe!)
```

### Database Updates:
```sql
-- Sale created
INSERT INTO sales (transaction_id, store_id, user_id, total...)

-- Items recorded
INSERT INTO sale_items (sale_id, product_id, quantity...)

-- Inventory updated
UPDATE products SET quantity = quantity - X WHERE id = Y
```
